   GEMINI FILE UPLOADS — no size cap of our own.
   Small files are sent inline as base64 (one request, no extra
   round trip). Anything too big for a single inline request is
   streamed straight to Google's Files API instead and referenced
   by URI — the bytes are sent directly from the File/Blob, so a
   large file never has to be fully base64-encoded in memory first.
   The only real ceiling left is the one the Gemini API itself
   enforces (2GB per file — included on the free tier), so this app
   no longer imposes anything smaller on top of that.
══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════ */

/* Bounding-box lookup (getBoundingBoxes, used by extractImagesForQuestions)
   asks about at most this many image-bearing questions per request instead
   of every one of them in a single call. Two independent problems this
   fixes:
     1. maxOutputTokens on that request is a fixed 4096 — a file with many
        image questions could produce a response that gets cut off
        mid-array, which fails JSON.parse and previously lost EVERY image
        in the file, not just the ones past the cutoff. A bounded batch
        keeps the expected response comfortably under that limit.
     2. A single 429 used to wipe out every image in the file at once
        (see callGeminiWithRetry's doc comment above getBoundingBoxes).
        Batching doesn't prevent a 429 — callGeminiWithRetry still retries/
        rotates/pauses on one same as before — but if a batch is the one
        that can't ultimately be recovered, only THAT batch's questions
        miss their image; every other batch in the file still succeeds
        independently, instead of an all-or-nothing result for the whole
        file. See extractImagesForQuestions below for the batching loop
        itself.
   Sized from the response shape, not guessed: each returned entry is
   `{ "q_index": 25, "page": 4, "x": 0.12, "y": 0.34, "w": 0.56, "h": 0.22 }`
   — roughly 20–25 tokens even accounting for formatting/whitespace — so 15
   entries lands around 300–375 tokens, well under the 4096 cap with a wide
   safety margin for a verbose or oddly-formatted response, while cutting
   the number of requests (and therefore rate-limit exposure) noticeably

/* Parses a JSON array returned by Gemini, and — if generation was cut off

   the whole response. Without this, one truncated response used to throw
   away ALL items already generated (a whole file's worth of questions, or
   every choice already written), not just the one that got cut off.

   Returns { data, truncated }:
     - data:      the parsed array (possibly shorter than what the model
                   intended to return), or null if nothing usable was found.
     - truncated: true if repair kicked in, so callers can flag the result

   Repair strategy: walk the raw text tracking string/escape state and
   bracket depth to find the exact character range of every top-level
   array element — an object ({...}), or a bare value (string/number/
   true/false/null, for arrays of strings like {"choices": [...]}'s inner
   array) — then JSON.parse each range ON ITS OWN, independently.

   This matters because a malformed response isn't always cut off at the
   very end — Gemini occasionally drops a comma or otherwise breaks the
   syntax of ONE element in the middle of an otherwise-complete array (this
   is what produced the "Expected ',' or '}' after property value" error
   reported against this function: a defect partway through the response,
   not a truncation at the tail). Re-parsing one giant prefix up to the
   last-recognized element boundary — the previous approach — still
   contains that bad element and fails identically. Parsing each element
   separately means a defect anywhere only drops the one entry it's in;

const CQ_EXTRACTION_PROMPT = `You are extracting multiple-choice quiz questions from an uploaded document (image or PDF).

STRICT RULES — follow exactly, no exceptions:
1. Extract EVERY single question that appears anywhere in the document. Do not skip, merge, summarize, or leave out any question — even ones that look incomplete, partial, blurry, or unusual.
2. Reproduce each question's text EXACTLY as written in the source — same wording, numbers, punctuation, and even typos. Do NOT correct, rephrase, shorten, translate, or "improve" anything.
3. Reproduce EVERY answer choice EXACTLY as written, in the same order, using the same labels (A, B, C, D, E, ... — convert numeric labels like 1,2,3 to A,B,C). Do not omit, reorder, merge, or reword any choice.
4. If the document indicates which choice is correct (circled, bolded, underlined, highlighted, starred, checked, or listed in a separate answer key), use EXACTLY that choice as the "answer" for that question. Do not second-guess or change a marked answer.
5. If a specific question has NO indicated correct answer anywhere in the document, set its "answer" to the special value "__NO_KEY__". Do NOT guess or infer an answer — use "__NO_KEY__" exactly.
6. Do not invent, add, duplicate, or remove any questions or options that are not present in the source document.
7. For each question, set "has_image" to true if THIS SPECIFIC question is accompanied by an image, diagram, figure, table, chart, graph, X-ray, CT scan, ECG, histology slide, or any other visual element that is part of it. Set it to false otherwise.
8. CASE / VIGNETTE CLUSTERS: sometimes a shared clinical case, patient vignette, scenario, lab panel, or image is presented ONCE and then several questions that follow it all refer back to it (e.g. "A 45-year-old man presents with... Questions 12–15 refer to the scenario above."), without repeating that shared information in each question's own text. Whenever you detect this pattern, structure it as ONE core question plus its dependent questions:
   - Identify the ONE question that is paired with the shared case/vignette/scenario/lab panel/image in the source document — this is the CORE question. Its "question" field MUST include the FULL case/vignette text verbatim (reproduced exactly as written, same as any other question text) followed by that question's own actual question — the case must live IN the core question's own text, never only in a separate field. Set "case_is_core" to true on this question. If the image is part of the case, set "has_image" true on this question.
   - For every OTHER question in the cluster (the dependents), keep its "question" field as ONLY that question's own specific wording — do NOT repeat the shared case text inside it, exactly as the source document itself doesn't repeat it. Set "case_is_core" to false (or omit it) on these.
   - Give every question in the cluster — the core question AND every question that depends on it — the SAME "case_group" string (e.g. "case_1", "case_2", ...). Leave "case_group" empty/omitted for standalone questions that don't share context with any other question.
   - Output the core question immediately followed by its dependent questions, in the same order they appear in the source document.
   - Do not invent a cluster — only use "case_group"/"case_is_core" when the source document actually presents shared context that multiple questions depend on. A cluster always needs exactly one core question — never zero, never more than one.
   - NESTED SUB-CASES (use this whenever the source itself nests context, not by default): sometimes ONE question inside a cluster introduces its OWN additional shared information — e.g. a follow-up lab result, imaging finding, or scenario update — that only SOME of the cluster's remaining questions depend on, while the rest still depend only on the outer case. When you see this, that in-between question becomes a "sub-case": give it a "case_link_id" string that's unique within this cluster (e.g. "sub_1"), still keep it in the same "case_group" as everything else, and leave its own "case_parent_id" pointing at whatever it itself depends on (empty/omitted if it depends directly on the outer case_group's core). Then, on each question that depends specifically on that sub-case rather than on the outer case directly, set "case_parent_id" to that same "case_link_id" string instead of leaving it empty. This can nest to any depth — a sub-case can itself have a further sub-case inside it — always by chaining "case_parent_id" to the immediate parent's own "case_link_id", never by inventing a second "case_group" for the nested part. A question with no "case_parent_id" set is understood to depend directly on the cluster's root core — this is the common case; only set "case_parent_id" when a question genuinely depends on a MORE SPECIFIC nested sub-case, not the outer one. Example: Q1 is the root core (case_group "case_1"). Q2 depends directly on Q1 (case_group "case_1", no case_parent_id). Q3 also depends directly on Q1, AND itself introduces a follow-up lab result some later questions depend on — so Q3 gets case_group "case_1", case_link_id "sub_1" (no case_parent_id of its own, since Q3 depends directly on Q1). Q4 and Q5 depend on that lab result specifically — both get case_group "case_1" and case_parent_id "sub_1".
9. CROSS-PAGE CONTINUATIONS: treat the ENTIRE document as one continuous stream of content — page boundaries are just where the scan/print was cut and carry NO semantic meaning. Never let a page break cause you to drop, truncate, or duplicate anything. Before you emit anything, apply this merging rule at EVERY page transition in the document: mentally stitch the bottom portion of page N directly onto the top portion of page N+1 and read that stitched region as a single uninterrupted block of content, exactly as if the page break were never there — do this for every single page boundary, not just ones that look like they cut something off. In particular, watch for these two exact failure patterns and never let either happen:
   - PATTERN A — stem on one page, only SOME of its choices on the next: the question stem and the first choice(s) (e.g. A–C) end at the bottom of one page, and the remaining choice(s) (e.g. D, or D and E) start at the top of the next page. The wrong behavior is emitting the question with only the choices found on the first page and silently leaving off the rest. The correct behavior: pull the remaining choice(s) from the top of the next page and merge them into the SAME question's "options" object, in their original A/B/C/D/E order, so the emitted question has every choice.
   - PATTERN B — stem on one page, ALL of its choices on the next: the question stem (and possibly its number) ends at the bottom of one page with no choices visible below it, and every one of its choices actually starts at the top of the next page. The wrong behavior is discarding the whole question because no complete question was visible on either page by itself. The correct behavior: recognize the stem at the bottom of one page as belonging to the choices at the top of the next page, and emit ONE complete question combining both — never drop the question just because its stem and its choices happened to fall on different pages.
   - The same stitching applies to an indicated correct answer split from its question this way — e.g. the stem and choices end one page and an underlined/circled/starred choice or "Ans: C" marking appears at the top of the next — or a question appearing on one page with its answer key only in an answer-key section on a different/later page. Always look across the WHOLE document and merge these into a single complete question object. Do not treat "no answer choices found on this page" or "question looks cut off at the page edge" as a reason to drop the question or drop any of its choices — first search the rest of the document (including the very next page and any answer-key section) for the missing pieces before falling back to the "no options" or "__NO_KEY__" handling.
   - Likewise, if an answer-key section (e.g. a list like "12-C, 13-A, 14-B...") appears anywhere in the document — even on a page far from the questions themselves, such as at the very end — match each entry to its corresponding question by number and use it to set "answer", even though the key is physically separated from the question text.
   - A case/vignette cluster (rule 8), including any nested sub-cases inside it, can itself span a page break — the shared case text may end one page and the dependent questions continue on the next; keep them in the same cluster (and the same sub-case nesting) and never cut the case text short just because the page changed.
   - Never emit a partial or truncated question just because its remaining text, options, or answer live on a different page. If, after checking the entire document, some piece genuinely cannot be found anywhere, apply rule 5 ("__NO_KEY__") for a missing answer, but still include every option and word of stem text that does exist anywhere in the document — do not drop the question outright.
   - FINAL CHECK before you output the array: walk through every page boundary in the document one more time and specifically ask, for each one, "is there a stem at the bottom of this page whose choices are missing or incomplete, and do they appear at the top of the next page? Is there a block of choices at the top of this page with no stem above them, meaning the stem is actually at the bottom of the previous page?" If either is true, that is exactly Pattern A or Pattern B above — go back and merge before finalizing your answer. Do this for every page transition, not only the ones that seem obviously cut off.

Return ONLY a JSON array, one object per question, in exactly this format:
[
  {
    "question": "exact question text",
    "options": { "A": "exact choice text", "B": "exact choice text", "C": "exact choice text", "D": "exact choice text" },
    "answer": "A",
    "has_image": false,
    "case_group": "",
    "case_is_core": false,
    "case_link_id": "",
    "case_parent_id": ""
  }
]

The "answer" value must be one of the keys present in that question's "options" object. Output nothing besides this JSON array — no markdown fences, no commentary.

Be fully deterministic: given the same document, always extract the exact same questions, options, and answers, in the exact same way every time.`;

/* ── Shared request pacing (prevents hitting Gemini's free-tier RPM cap) ──
   Google's free tier caps Gemini 2.5 Flash at roughly 10–15 requests per
   minute *per project* (see https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/docs/rate-limits) —
   and that cap is shared across every request this app makes with a given
   key, no matter which feature fired it.

   Extraction only ever sends one request per uploaded file (usually just a
   couple), so it naturally stays well under that cap. The bulk per-question
   passes — AI Solve, Fill Choices, Refine Questions, whether run from the
   post-extraction pipeline or from an editor's own bulk-tools panel — fire
   one request per question (or per 20-question batch, for Solve) and used
   to only pace themselves internally (250ms, or nothing at all) — nowhere
   near enough spacing, and each loop only knew about its OWN requests, so
   two bulk passes running at once (e.g. one editor's Fill Choices while
   another's Refine is also going) could double up and blow through the cap
   even faster.

   This gate enforces one shared minimum spacing between ANY two Gemini
   requests the app sends, tracked globally rather than per-loop, so every
   caller — bulk or single, extraction or editor — automatically queues
   behind the same pace instead of assuming it has the whole rate budget to
   itself. If your key is on a paid tier (much higher RPM), this constant
   can safely be lowered. */

/* ── Retry helper: retries indefinitely with exponential back-off (2s, 4s, 8s… capped at 30s).
   Only surfaces an error immediately if it's API-key-related
   (HTTP 400 with API_KEY_INVALID / 401 / 403) AND no other configured
   API key can be rotated to instead (see SMART API ROTATION below).

   A bad-request response — HTTP 404 ("model not found") or HTTP 400
   ("bad request", e.g. an invalid model name/parameter) — does NOT
   surface immediately and does NOT change the loop's structure — it
   still goes through the exact same onRetry/backoff/continue path as any
   other error below. The only extra thing that happens is that `url`
   gets corrected in place to point at GEMINI_FALLBACK_MODEL before that
   same retry fires, so the loop it's already going to run keeps
   retrying, just against a request that's actually able to succeed.
   Both statuses are handled identically via resolveGeminiFallbackUrl();
   see the model config at the top of this file for
   GEMINI_PRIMARY_MODEL / GEMINI_FALLBACK_MODEL /
   GEMINI_MODEL_FALLBACK_STATUSES. A 400 whose message names an
   API_KEY_* error is still caught by isKeyError() below FIRST, so
   genuine key problems never fall through to this fallback path.

   The API key is sent via the `x-goog-api-key` header (Google's documented
   auth method: https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/docs/api-key), NOT as a
   `?key=` query parameter. As of mid-2026 Google AI Studio issues new keys
   in the "Auth key" format (prefixed `AQ.`, replacing the old `AIza...`
   "Standard key" format) — Auth keys are unreliable when passed as a query
   parameter (inconsistent 401/403/404 responses depending on the account),
   but work correctly via this header regardless of which key format the
   user has. Every caller must pass `apiKey` in the options object instead
   of appending it to `url` itself.

   ── SMART API ROTATION ──
   This function is the single place rotation actually happens, so every
   feature that calls it (extraction, generation, explanations, chat, bulk
   tools…) gets it for free with no per-feature plumbing:
     - Each key's consecutive-429 streak is tracked centrally (js/api-rotation.js),
       not just for this one call — so the "3 strikes" rule holds even
       across separate calls/questions using the same key back to back.
     - The moment a key crosses that threshold, the ACTIVE key is switched
       (setActiveApiKeyId) and every "currently using…" badge/button in the
       UI is refreshed immediately (see _broadcastRotationUI), then this
       same retry loop just continues with the new key — the caller's own
       state (loop position, accumulated results, etc.) is completely
       untouched, since none of that ever left this one function call.
     - A rotation also resets the resolved model back to
       GEMINI_PRIMARY_MODEL (see resetGeminiModelResolution) — exactly the
       same as opening the site fresh — since a model that needed the
       fallback on one key/project isn't guaranteed to need it on another.
     - If the request carried an uploaded (Files-API) document, that
       reference belongs to the OLD key/project and won't resolve under the
       new one — so when `fileForReupload` is given, the file is silently
       re-uploaded under the new key and the request body patched in place
       before the retry fires.
     - If literally every configured key is currently excluded (all rate-
       limited / invalid), rotation keeps cycling between them anyway
       (a key's cooldown can lapse at any moment) instead of getting stuck
       on one — see pickNextApiKey()'s doc comment. `onAllRateLimited`, if
       given, fires once per attempt so callers can surface a persistent
       "add another key" note while this is happening.
     - A brand-new key pasted in mid-run is picked up on the very next
       rotation decision with no extra wiring — pickNextApiKey() always
       reads the live key list fresh. While a call is asleep between
       retries with nothing left to rotate to, that sleep also wakes early
       the instant the key list changes, instead of finishing its full
       backoff first.
     - On success, the returned object gets two extra (non-API) fields
       attached — `__rotatedApiKey` and `__rotatedFilePart` — set only if
       a rotation actually happened during this call, so callers that keep
       their own local `apiKey`/`filePart` variables for later requests
       (e.g. the extraction pipeline's follow-up image-cropping pass) can
       pick up the values that actually ended up succeeding. ──────── */

/* ── Main: extract images from source for all has_image questions ──
   Accepts the File itself (not raw base64) so it can decide, via
   buildGeminiFilePart, whether to send it inline or through Gemini's
   Files API depending on size — this is what makes bounding-box lookups
   work correctly for large PDFs/images, not just the initial extraction.
   An already-built `filePart` can optionally be passed in (e.g. by the
   main extraction call, which builds one anyway) to avoid uploading the
   same large file to the Files API twice.

   `customInstructions` is optional and forwarded as-is to getBoundingBoxes
   — used only by a manual single-question re-extract (cqReextractImage in
   ai-solve.js) to let the user correct a mistake they've actually seen
   (e.g. "widen the frame", "wrong position, it's the graph on page 2").
   Left undefined on the normal bulk pass, so nothing changes there.

   `cancelToken` is likewise optional and forwarded to getBoundingBoxes —
   lets a manual re-extract's ⏹ Stop button actually abort the in-flight
   request (see cqReextractImage), rather than just hiding the busy state
   while the request keeps running unseen.

   `pauseCheck` is optional and forwarded to getBoundingBoxes, which in turn
   hands it straight to callGeminiWithRetry (see its doc comment above) —
   this is what lets a run of consecutive 429s pause into the same "all
   keys rate-limited" UI as every other step of extraction, instead of
   retrying silently in the background. Passed by the main bulk pass
   (_extractQuestionsFromFile in ai-solve.js), which already has that
   pause/resume UI to fall back into. Left undefined by the single-question
   🔁 Re-extract Image path (cqReextractImage), matching every other
   per-question AI tool (aiRefineQuestion, aiFillChoices, …), which just
   retries with backoff/rotation until it succeeds or the user hits Stop.

   `fileForReupload` is NOT a parameter — it's built here, from `file` and
   the `mimeType` already computed below, and forwarded to getBoundingBoxes
   for every caller automatically. This is what lets callGeminiWithRetry
   silently re-upload the file and get a fresh Files API reference if the
   one in `filePart`/`part` has gone stale (e.g. rotated onto a different
   API key mid-request — see its doc comment), rather than every caller
   having to remember to build and pass this itself.

   Bounding-box lookup itself happens in batches of
   GEMINI_BOUNDING_BOX_BATCH_SIZE image-bearing questions per request, not
   all of them in one call — see that constant's doc comment near the top
   of this file. A batch that can't ultimately be recovered just leaves its
   own questions without an image; every other batch in the file is
   requested and resolved independently, so one bad or rate-limited batch
   no longer costs the whole file its images. ── */

/* ── Post-extraction bulk pass: Re-extract Missing Images (cq preview only) ──
   Finds every question Gemini flagged as having an image (has_image) that
   never actually got one cropped — the same "⚠️ AI detected an image…
   couldn't extract it" case handled per-question by 🔁 Re-extract Image in
   renderCQPreview (js/ai-solve.js) — and retries extraction for all of
   them in one pass.

   Grouped and requested per SOURCE FILE, one file at a time, reusing
   extractImagesForQuestions exactly as the original extraction pass does
   (js/ai-solve.js, _extractQuestionsFromFile) — which itself batches
   GEMINI_BOUNDING_BOX_BATCH_SIZE image-bearing questions per request. This
   is deliberately NOT an additive per-question loop making one Gemini
   request per image; it's the same file-scoped batching used when the
   quiz was first extracted, just re-run only for the questions still
   missing an image.

   Only questions with a traceable source file are eligible — same rule as
   the single-question control (_canReextract: `q._sourceFile &&
   !q._notExtractable`). Hand-typed questions, or ones merged in from
   another quiz (see _mergeCloneQuestions in community-quizzes.js), have no
