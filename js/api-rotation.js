/* ══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
   SMART API KEY ROTATION ENGINE
   Sits on top of the API Key Manager (js/ai-features.js) and the
   Gemini request layer (js/gemini-uploads.js). This is the ONE place
   that decides:
     - when a key counts as excluded — either "rate-limited" (2
       consecutive HTTP 429s) or "model error" (2 consecutive plain
       HTTP 400s that aren't a key-error) — both use the same
       2-strikes threshold and cooldown, just tracked as separate
       streaks and labeled differently in the UI
     - which key to rotate to next
     - what happens once every configured key is excluded
     - how the UI (badges, quick buttons, the Manager modal) finds out
       a rotation just happened, so they can update live

   Design notes:
   - All state here is in-memory only (per browser tab/session) and is
     keyed by API key id, not by position — so adding/removing/editing
     keys elsewhere never desyncs this from the real key list.
   - Nothing in this file ever touches the request/response bodies
     themselves — that stays in callGeminiWithRetry (gemini-uploads.js),
     which calls into the functions below at the right moments.
   - Every lookup here reads the live key list via loadApiKeys() (which
     reads straight from localStorage) instead of caching it, so a key
     added mid-run is available to the very next rotation decision —
     no extra wiring needed for "pick up new keys instantly".

// Persisted on/off switch for the whole rotation engine. Defaults to ON
// (matches every previous version's always-on behavior) so upgrading
// existing users never silently changes anything. Turning it off doesn't
// touch key health tracking or the status chips — it only stops
// pickNextApiKey() from ever handing back a key to switch to, which is
// the single choke point every rotation decision in the app goes through
// (see callGeminiWithRetry -> _tryRotate in js/gemini-uploads.js). With
// it off, a rate-limited/invalid key just fails and retries/backs off on
// itself, exactly like a single-key setup always has.
